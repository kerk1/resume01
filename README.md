# cloud_resume_challange

I read some interesting challange here: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

So I thought I should do it. And I did most of it.

I didn't speed time doing everything by hand - I decided to write everything from the very beginning. I skipped the part regarding HTTPS and DNS I also skipped the part about CI/CD.

I'm not proud of this project - but hey, it's working!
